# ============================================
# CONFIGURATION FOR DOCKER COMPOSE (RECOMMENDED)
# ============================================
# When using Docker Compose, secrets should be stored in files
# in the ./secrets/ directory instead of using environment variables.
# See ./secrets/README.md for setup instructions.
#
# Files needed in ./secrets/:
# - jwt_secret.txt
# - admin_username.txt  
# - admin_password_hash_base64.txt
#
# This is more secure as secrets are never exposed in environment variables
# and can be properly managed with Docker secrets.

# ============================================
# CONFIGURATION FOR DEVELOPMENT (NO DOCKER)
# ============================================
# For local development without Docker, you can use environment variables.
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values.

# Admin-Daten
ADMIN_USERNAME=username

# Admin Passwort Hash (Base64 verschlüsselt)
# Generate using: node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); const password = 'your-password'; const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, 10); const base64 = Buffer.from(hash).toString('base64'); console.log('ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH_BASE64=' + base64);"
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH_BASE64=bcrypthash

# JWT Secret (must be at least 32 characters)
# Generate using: openssl rand -base64 32
JWT_SECRET=secret
